"""
Prompt_toolkit is designed a way that the amount of changing state is reduced
to a minimum. Where possible, code is written in a pure functional way. In
general, this results in code where the flow is very easy to follow: the value
of a variable can be deducted from its first assignment.

However, often, practicality and performance beat purity and some classes still
have a changing state. In order to not having to care too much about
transferring states between several components we use some reactive
programming. Actually some kind of data binding.

We introduce two types:

- Filter: for binding a boolean state. They can be chained using & and |
  operators. Have a look in the ``filters`` module. Resolving the actual value
  of a filter happens by calling it.

- Integer: for binding integer values. Reactive operations (like addition and
  subtraction) are not supported. Resolving the actual value happens by
  casting it to int, like  ``int(integer)``. This way, it is possible to use
  normal integers as well for static values.
