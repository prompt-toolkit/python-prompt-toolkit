Mouse events.


How it works
------------

The renderer has a 2 dimensional grid of mouse event handlers.
(`prompt_toolkit.layout.MouseHandlers`.) When the layout is rendered, the
`Window` class will make sure that this grid will also be filled with
callbacks. For vt100 terminals, mouse events are received through stdin, just
like any other key press. There is a handler among the key bindings that
catches these events and forwards them to such a mouse event handler. It passes
through the `Window` class where the coordinates are translated from absolute
coordinates to coordinates relative to the user control, and there
`UIControl.mouse_handler` is called.
