The Token class, interchangeable with ``pygments.token``.

A `Token` has some semantics for a piece of text that is given a style through
a :class:`~prompt_toolkit.styles.Style` class. A pygments lexer for instance,
returns a list of (Token, text) tuples. Each fragment of text has a token
assigned, which when combined with a style sheet, will determine the fine
style.
