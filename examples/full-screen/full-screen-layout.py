# 1. Create an event loop
#    --------------------

# We need to create an eventloop for this application. An eventloop is
# basically a while-true loop that waits for user input, and when it receives
# something (like a key press), it will send that to the application. Usually,
# you want to use this `create_eventloop` shortcut, which -- according to the
# environment (Windows/posix) -- returns something that will work there. If you
# want to run your application inside an "asyncio" environment, you'd have to
# pass another eventloop.

loop = create_event_loop()


# 3. Create the buffers
#    ------------------

left_buffer = Buffer(loop=loop)
right_buffer = Buffer(loop=loop)

# 1. First we create the layout
#    --------------------------

left_window = Window(BufferControl(buffer=left_buffer))
right_window = Window(BufferControl(buffer=right_buffer))


body = VSplit([
    left_window,

    # A vertical line in the middle. We explicitely specify the width, to make
    # sure that the layout engine will not try to divide the whole width by
    # three for all these windows. The `FillControl` will simply fill the whole
    # window by repeating this character.
    Window(width=D.exact(1),
           content=FillControl.from_character_and_token('|', token=Token.Line)),

    # Display the Result buffer on the right.
    right_window,
])

# As a demonstration. Let's add a title bar to the top, displaying "Hello world".

# somewhere, because usually the default key bindings include searching. (Press
# Ctrl-R.) It would be really annoying if the search key bindings are handled,
# but the user doesn't see any feedback. We will add the search toolbar to the
# bottom by using an HSplit.

def get_titlebar_tokens(app):
    return [
        (Token.Title, ' Hello world '),
        (Token.Title, ' (Press [Ctrl-Q] to quit.)'),
    ]

root_container = HSplit([
    # The titlebar.
    Window(height=D.exact(1),
           content=TokenListControl(get_titlebar_tokens),
           align=Align.CENTER),

    # Horizontal separator.
    Window(height=D.exact(1),
           content=FillControl.from_character_and_token('-', token=Token.Line)),

    # The 'body', like defined above.
    body,
])


# 2. Adding key bindings
#   --------------------

# As a demonstration, we will add just a ControlQ key binding to exit the
# application.  Key bindings are registered in a
# `prompt_toolkit.key_bindings.registry.Registry` instance. We use the
# `load_default_key_bindings` utility function to create a registry that
# already contains the default key bindings.

kb = KeyBindings()

# Now add the Ctrl-Q binding. We have to pass `eager=True` here. The reason is
# that there is another key *sequence* that starts with Ctrl-Q as well. Yes, a
# key binding is linked to a sequence of keys, not necessarily one key. So,
# what happens if there is a key binding for the letter 'a' and a key binding
# for 'ab'. When 'a' has been pressed, nothing will happen yet. Because the
# next key could be a 'b', but it could as well be anything else. If it's a 'c'
# for instance, we'll handle the key binding for 'a' and then look for a key
# binding for 'c'. So, when there's a common prefix in a key binding sequence,
# prompt-toolkit will wait calling a handler, until we have enough information.

# Now, There is an Emacs key binding for the [Ctrl-Q Any] sequence by default.
# Pressing Ctrl-Q followed by any other key will do a quoted insert. So to be
# sure that we won't wait for that key binding to match, but instead execute
# Ctrl-Q immediately, we can pass eager=True. (Don't make a habbit of adding
# `eager=True` to all key bindings, but do it when it conflicts with another
# existing key binding, and you definitely want to override that behaviour.

@kb.add(Keys.ControlC, eager=True)
@kb.add(Keys.ControlQ, eager=True)
def _(event):

    interface and return this value from the `CommandLineInterface.run()` call.

    executing `stty -ixon`.
